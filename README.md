# Walkable City, a simple app to find your nearest public transportation hub

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## How to use

Right click on the map to select a location.

Click on 'Nearest Stations' for the 5 closest public transportation stops within 500 meters.

Click on 'Save Location' to save your selected location.

On the top right, the menu icon allows access to the saved coordinates tab, which you can have up to 20 and can go directly to said coordinates with the corresponding button.
